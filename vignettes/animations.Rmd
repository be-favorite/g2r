Animations can be created using the `Animation` object or the `new_animation` class. This object can be passed to `fig_` functions.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(g2r)
```

```{r}
library(g2r)

anim <- Animation$
  new()$
  appear(duration = 2500, delay = 1000)

iris %>% 
  g2(asp(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width, color = Species)) %>% 
  fig_point(asp(shape = "circle"), anim)
```

The above only configures the animations of the plot appearing on the page, similar animations can be customised when the plot is updated or a figure removed though these will only be relevant [shiny](shiny.html) or [rmarkdown](actions.html) where such events occur.
