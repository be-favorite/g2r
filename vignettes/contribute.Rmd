```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(g2r)
```

## Setup

g2r is an [htmlwidgets](http://htmlwidgets.org/) build with [packer](https://packer.john-coene.com/) so it can make use of the `@antv/g2` NPM package and webpack to modularise the code.

First, make sure you have packer installed: `install.packages("packer")`.

Then, clone the project.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/devOpifex/g2r.git
cd g2r
```

As mentioned, [packer](https://packer.john-coene.com/) is used to manage webpack and NPM with R: run the function below install the dependencies.

```r
packer::npm_install()
```

All the JavaScript code is placed in the `srcjs` directory. The core htmlwidget file is placed in the `srcjs/widget` directory, it makes use of various modules in the `srcjs/modules` directory.

Make changes or additions to those file then bundle them with packer.

```r
packer::bundle_prod()
```

Make sure you bundle for prod, you can run the dev bundle as you try things out (it puts the sourcemap inline for debugging) but make sure you only push the prod bundle as part of the PR.

in any event, `R CMD Check` will raise a warning with the dev bundle as the file is too large. 

The easiest way is to use the `make`.

```bash
make build
```

## Figures & Alter

G2.js figures are all handled in the `primitives.R` file; if adding a figure please place it in with other such custom figures in `figures.R`.

Many figures internally use the [alter](https://github.com/devOpifex/alter) package which interfaces the `@antv/data-set` package.
