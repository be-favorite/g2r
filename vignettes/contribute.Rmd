## Setup

g2r is an [htmlwidgets](http://htmlwidgets.org/) build with [packer](https://packer.john-coene.com/) so it can make use of the `@antv/g2` NPM package and webpack to modularise the code.

### Make

Using `make` is probably the easiest way.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/devOpifex/g2r.git
cd g2r
make init
```

### Manual

First, make sure you have packer installed: `install.packages("packer")`.

Then, clone the project.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/devOpifex/g2r.git
cd g2r
```

As mentioned, [packer](https://packer.john-coene.com/) is used to manage webpack and NPM with R: run the function below install the dependencies.

```r
packer::npm_install()
```

All the JavaScript code is placed in the `srcjs` directory. The core htmlwidget file is placed in the `srcjs/widget` directory, it makes use of various modules in the `srcjs/modules` directory.

## Development

Make changes or additions to those file then bundle them with packer.

```r
packer::bundle_dev()
```

The above bundles the JavaScript with inline sourcemap for debugging. This, however, creates a large `.js` file which breaks `R CMD Check`, etc. Only use it as you develop and do not submit PR with the sourcemap, do not build [pkgdown](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown) site with this large JavaScript file either.

Make sure you bundle for prod which performs all required optimisations (tree-shaking, minification, etc.).

```r
packer::bundle_prod()
```

It is advised to make use of the `makefile` to ensure one does not miss any of the required steps.

```bash
make build
```

## Figures & Alter

G2.js figures are all handled in the `primitives.R` file; if adding a figure please place it in with other such custom figures in `figures.R`.

Do not change "primitives" (unless fixing a bug). There should remain a simple, straightforward 1:1 mapping to the G2.js geoms.

Many figures internally use the [alter](https://github.com/devOpifex/alter) package which interfaces the `@antv/data-set` package.

## Tests

Any additions, fixes, etc. __must__ be accompanied by tests.

## Man & Docs

Make sure document your functions with roxygen2 with examples, etc. Optionally, add something to the pkgdown site.

```bash
make site
```

## Dependencies

Do not introduce new dependencies unless absolutely necessary. If needed them to `Suggests` and use the internal `check_package` to check whether said package is installed.

##Â News

Update the `NEWS.md` file with the changes you have made.

## Tests

Add tests for the functionalities you propose.
